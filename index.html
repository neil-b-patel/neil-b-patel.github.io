      <p>Welcome to <b>Another Shallow Internet Alcove</b>.</p>
      <p>
        First, check out my blog - <a href="https://blog.neilbpatel.com/"><b>The Algomist</b></a

        I'm just another <b><s>cantankerous</s> charming engineer</b>.

        When I'm not <b><i>Bash</i></b

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Drinking <b><i>Java</i></b> - I prefer Americanos and a "high-level, class-based, object-oriented
            programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible."<sup>1</sup>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Reading <b><i>(Java)script</i></b
            >s - I'm proud to claim that I've started reading "GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach" 3 times over the last 3 years.
            Please don't spoil anything after the foreword.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Catching <b><i>Pythons</i></b> - This is not true, I'm just struggling to continue this gag at this point.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Running up E<b><i>Scala</i></b
            >tors - Okay, okay. I get it. "This is really stretching it," you think. But you try thinking of words that
            have "Scala" in them.

        Excuse my lack of frequent updates to this website, my blog, social media, and even my GitHub. I wonder if it's
        because the concept of "branding" is antithetical to authenticity. Seeking to distinguish yourself from others
        while remaining respectable (and employeeable) confines how much of yourself can be presented online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've grown up on the web and each year I've left enough forgotten breadcrumbs of content to feed a village.
        Instead of posting inspiring content on LinkedIn that I may find in poor taste later, I'll trudge through my
        delusional thoughts alone. My GitHub profile doesn't require weekly updates to my "About Me".
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you are a younger professional or creator, I'll leave you with these words (that are my own but I've
        formatted as block quote for emphasis):
      </p>
      <blockquote>You are not your work.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>You influence your work and vise versa, but that is no excuse to let it consume you.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        It is all too easy to sacrifice your identity, your relationships, or your health for success.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>Understand where your work ends and where you start.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Most importantly, do not mistake that demarcation as weakness in your drive.</blockquote>

      <p>With that out of the way, bookmark these pages, follow me, connect with me, et cetera, et cetera:</p>
