A simple json-like web portfolio made using the [hacked-jekyll](https://github.com/piazzai/hacked-jekyll) theme and served via GitHub pages.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Ruby >= 3.0 and the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) Ruby Gem is required.

I used [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) to download Ruby versions and [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) for managing version installations.

For Homebrew installations on MacOS, run:
```bash
homebrew install ruby-install
homebrew install chruby
```

Then, follow instructions to install an appropriate Ruby version and switch to using it.

### Building

```bash
bundle
```

### Localhost Serve

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
